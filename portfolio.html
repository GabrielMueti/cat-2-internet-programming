            <p>I was born in a hospital in Nairobi. At the time we lived in Dandora but relocated to Kitui when I turned 2. My early years were filled with playful adventures and learning about the world around me.</p>
            <p>Growing up in a nurturing environment helped me develop a strong sense of curiosity and creativity. I enjoyed playing outdoors and learning from the experiences of elders in my neighborhood.</p>
